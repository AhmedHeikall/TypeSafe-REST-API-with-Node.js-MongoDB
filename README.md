**Building a REST API with Node.js, Express, TypeScript, and MongoDB (With Authentication)**

This project is focused on creating a robust and scalable RESTful API using modern web development technologies. The API is built with **Node.js** and **Express.js** for handling server-side logic, **TypeScript** for enhanced type safety and developer productivity, and **MongoDB** as the database for managing and storing application data.

### Key Features:

1. **RESTful Design**: Well-structured endpoints following REST principles to ensure maintainability and scalability.
2. **TypeScript Integration**: Full TypeScript support, enabling strong typing and reducing runtime errors.
3. **Authentication**: Secure user authentication implemented using industry standards such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth2.
4. **Database Management**: MongoDB for efficient, NoSQL data storage, with integration through Mongoose for schema validation and query handling.
5. **Middleware**: Custom middleware for request validation, logging, and error handling.
6. **Security Enhancements**: Implementation of security best practices, including input sanitization, password hashing, and secure communication via HTTPS.
7. **Scalability**: Modular code structure to allow for easy extension and deployment.

### Learning Objectives:

- Understand how to set up a backend application using Node.js, Express, and TypeScript.
- Learn to design RESTful APIs for various CRUD operations.
- Implement robust user authentication and authorization systems.
- Gain experience working with MongoDB for database operations.
- Explore best practices for building secure, maintainable, and scalable APIs.

This project is ideal for developers looking to gain hands-on experience with building a modern backend application while adhering to industry standards. The end product can serve as a foundation for more complex applications, such as web apps, mobile apps, or microservices.
